# text_classification

## Project goal

The goal of the project is to build a model that is able to classify sentences drawn from political speeches from Chirac and Mitterand.

## Provided data

The data is split into two datasets: the training dataset which contains labels and the test dataset which does not. The datasets come with the raw data as well as a vocabulary (dict.pkl file) and the sequences representing the sentences.
